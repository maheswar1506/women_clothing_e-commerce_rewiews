From Notebook_1 we get the following inferences:

1. Logistic Regression   : 93.04%
2. KNeighborsClassifier  : 92.45%
3. DecisionTreeClassifier: 91.23%
4. Naive Bayes           : 89.58%

lOGISTIC REGRESSION works best for our data set followed by KNeighborsClassifier.

From Notebook_2 we get the following inferences:

Model with SVM using hyperparameters tuning we get the efficiency upto 93.43
